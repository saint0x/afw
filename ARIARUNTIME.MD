### Context API\n- ⭕ Design secure, read-only endpoint for context access (`/context`)\n- ⭕ Implement granular context retrieval (e.g., get specific step output)\n- ⭕ Add context filtering to avoid leaking sensitive information\n- ⭕ Define schema for context API responses\n- ⭕ Implement endpoint for suggesting context additions\n- ⭕ Document Context API for tool and agent developers\n\n### Message Queue (MQ) Integration (Future)\n- ⭕ **Architectural Goal**: Evolve the runtime from a synchronous request-response model to an asynchronous, event-driven architecture for enhanced scalability and resilience.\n- ⭕ **Asynchronous Workloads**: Enable \"fire and forget\" long-running tasks. An agent could place a job on a queue (e.g., \"process large dataset\") and receive a `job_id` for later reference, freeing it to perform other tasks.\n- ⭕ **Inter-Agent Communication**: Provide a backbone for a future multi-agent swarm architecture. Agents could delegate tasks or broadcast findings to each other by publishing messages to dedicated topics.\n- ⭕ **System-Wide Eventing**: Allow subsystems like `quiltd` to publish critical events (`container_crashed`, `resource_threshold_exceeded`). The runtime can subscribe to these events to trigger intelligent, reactive behaviors instead of relying on polling.\n- ⭕ **Resilience & Decoupling**: Introduce a buffer between components, allowing the system to gracefully handle temporary service outages and queue work for later processing.\n\n### Bundle Integration\n- ✅ Integrate with `pkg_store` for bundle loading\n- ⭕ Implement dynamic tool/agent registration from bundles
